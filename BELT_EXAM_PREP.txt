EXAM is emulating a take home challenge
The exam is written as a real life example of a potential employer giving you a timed exercise to test your knowledge

1. take 100% of the exam time! (4.5 hours + 30 mins)
DO NOT DROP EARLY - take breaks
👉 Ask Clarification questions

2. Don't panic!
- the only risk here is for you to find and expose a weakness to study and correct! 🙂
- receive feedback

3. Don't watch the clock ⏳
- set alarms for mid way - last hour and last 20 mins

4. Start with what you know
- Red belt vs Black belt

5. Don't start the exam until you have your environment setup and ready
- 📂 flask_app
	📂controllers
	    users_controller.py
	📂models
	    user_model.py
	📂config
	    mysqlconnection.py
	📂templates

6. Use exam instructions as checklist and follow the yellow sticky notes
- double check before submitting***
- don't overthink features - do only what the exam asks

7. Use the platform - 100% of the RED BELT features are IN the platform.

8. always include your *.mwb (SQL MODEL file)
  I cannot grade the exam without it - VOID if not included

9. Don't go over time, submit anyway I will still code review it with you.
- ALWAYS submit what you have
- not submitting is automatic FAIL

10. Even if you are feeling nervous - Take the exam anyway as an assignment and finish it

11. You don't have to submit a video*

12. STAY IN ZOOM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME OF THE EXAM 
- DON'T EXIT ZOOM

THUR - 10:00 - start by 11:00a MT


15. Don't cheat. PERIOD
- it's very easy to catch cheaters
- code is like a fingerprint
- you need to feel comfortable about what you do and do not know to survive an engineering role
